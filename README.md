# django-docker-psql-cookiecutter

This is not currently ready to use.

It contains my personal preferences for developing my solo Django projects, so naturally it's opinionated. It's like a less-flexible version of [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django)

* Docker & compose for development and production
* Pipenv
* Postgresql
* Custom user model for Django
* Tailwind
* Pytest
* Black, flake8, isort with pre-commit hooks
